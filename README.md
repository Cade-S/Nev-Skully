## ALWAYS GET THE .GBC UNLESS EXPLCITELY TESTING FOR THE OG GAMEBOY.
# Nev & Skully
  A puzzle platformer for the Gameboy Color. The game centers around you- Nev- and your 
companion Skully.

*understand that this game is developed for and works on all Gameboy models; therefore, the technical limitations are far beyond what most are aware of. Adjust your expectations accordingly, but still, judge critically.*

#Key features that are important to me

- Intuitive controls/platformer mechanics that make the game fun regardless of story or other motives.
- A fun story that interests the player. I want there to be an emotional connection to the story without trying too hard or being cheesy. Skully is there for comic relief.
- A pleasing, consistent art style

#Features that should hopefully happen

- Music for every mood/ level.
- Sound effects for jumping, etc. (The technical limitations make this VERY tricky.)
- A 10+ hour story.
